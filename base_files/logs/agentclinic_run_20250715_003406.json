While other specialists such as radiologists (for imaging) and breast surgeons (for biopsy and surgical management) are involved in the diagnostic process, the overarching specialist responsible for diagnosis, treatment planning, and ongoing care in suspected breast cancer cases is an **Oncologist**.",
