These are complex neurological symptoms involving muscle control and nerve-muscle communication, which fall within the expertise of a neurologist. **Summary:** A neurologist specializes in diagnosing and managing neurological and neuromuscular disorders, making them the most appropriate specialist to evaluate, confirm diagnosis, and initiate treatment for this patient's suspected myasthenia gravis.",
