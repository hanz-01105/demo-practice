Given these factors, a **Vascular Surgeon** is the most appropriate specialist to evaluate potential vascular issues such as peripheral arterial disease or compromised blood flow, which are common in diabetic patients and can impair wound healing or contribute to ulcer formation. Addressing vascular insufficiency is crucial for effective management and healing of the ulcer. **Therefore, the most relevant medical specialist type is: Vascular Surgeon.**",
